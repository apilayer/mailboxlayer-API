# mailboxlayer API

Mailboxlayer offers a simple REST-based JSON API enabling you to thouroughly check and verify email addresses as they come into your system.

In addition to checking the syntax and the actual existence of an email address using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the mailboxlayer API is linked to a number of regularly updated databases containing all available email providers, which simplifies the separation of disposable (e.g. "mailinator") and free email addresses (e.g. "gmail", "yahoo") from individual domains.

Combined with typo checks, did-you-mean suggestions and a numeric score reflecting the quality of each email address, these structures will make it simple to automatically filter "real" customers from abusers and increase response and success rates of your email campaigns.

## Data Sources

In order to achieve a high standard of data accuracy and response speed for every API request, the mailboxlayer API relies on multiple servers and a distinct "fallback & validation" mechanism, consisting of a fairly large number of different data sources (instances), which include the European Commission's databases. 

If one instance fails to deliver an accurate data response (which does not even occur in 99.9% of the cases), the next highest one is assigned with the respective request. Only this way can we provide a consistent service and API living up to our customer's expectations.

## Features & Integration

At mailboxlayer we believe that every online business should be verifying email addresses before letting them into their database, that is why we decided to offer 1,000 monthly validation requests for free - no credit card, no charges. After all, *"2837484@mailinator.com"* may just not be your target demographic.

The main API Functionalities are:

* **Syntax & Typo Check**:
Thorough syntax validation, typo check and useful alternative (did you mean?) email suggestions.

* **Real-time SMTP**:
Each email address is "pinged" by a would-be email server in order to verify its actual existence.

* **Role Check**:
Filter "role" email addresses that are typically associated with a function instead of a person.

* **Free Providers**:
Separate addresses using free email providers like "Gmail" or "Yahoo!" from individual domains.

* **Disposable Providers**:
Separate addresses using disposable email providers like "mailinator.com" from individual domains.

* **Quality Score**:
Make use of a numeric score reflecting the quality and deliverability of each email address.
